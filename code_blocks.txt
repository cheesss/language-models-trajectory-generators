["I have detected the box in the environment.

Since all boxes are the same, I will choose the first one.\n\nNow, I will plan the trajectory to approach the box, lower the gripper to make contact, and then lift it. The approach will be as follows:\n\n1. **Approach the box**: Move to the position directly above the box, at a height of 0.55 m (current height) and a slight offset to ensure the gripper is centered over the box.\n2. **Lower the gripper**: Move down to the height of the box (0.145 m) to make contact.\n3. **Close the gripper**: Grasp the box.\n4. **Lift the box**: Raise the box to a safe height (0.55 m) to avoid collisions with the tabletop.\n5. **Move to a designated location**: (This step will be defined later, but for now, I will just lift it).\n\nLet's proceed with the code to define the trajectory for these steps.\n\n", '\n# Step 1: Approach the box\ndef trajectory_1_approach_box():\n    start_position = [0.0, 0.6, 0.55]  # Current position\n    target_position = [-0.192, 0.474, 0.55]  # Above the box\n    trajectory = []\n    \n    # Generate trajectory points\n    for i in range(100):\n        t = i / 99  # Normalized time\n        x = start_position[0] + t * (target_position[0] - start_position[0])\n        y = start_position[1] + t * (target_position[1] - start_position[1])\n        z = start_position[2] + t * (target_position[2] - start_position[2])\n        trajectory.append([x, y, z, 0])  # Rotation is 0 radians\n    \n    return trajectory\n\ntrajectory_1 = trajectory_1_approach_box()\nexecute_trajectory(trajectory_1)\n```']
