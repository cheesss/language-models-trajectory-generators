I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding.

Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3.

If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6.

Unfortunately, I cannot modify the underlying system or the environment in which the code is running. However, I can suggest a few general strategies to mitigate this issue:\n\n1. **Reduce Batch Size**: If the code allows for it, reducing the batch size can help decrease memory usage.\n\n2. **Clear Unused Variables**: Ensure that any unnecessary variables are deleted or set to `None` to free up memory.\n\n3. **Use CPU Instead of GPU**: If possible, switch to using the CPU for processing, which may be slower but does not have the same memory limitations.\n\n4. **Restart the Environment**: Sometimes, simply restarting the environment can free up memory that was not properly released.\n\n5. **Set Memory Growth**: If using TensorFlow, you can set memory growth to avoid allocating all memory at once.\n\nSince I cannot implement these changes directly, I recommend trying to run the detection code again after applying one or more of these strategies. If you have access to modify the code, you can also try to implement these suggestions.\n\nIf you would like to proceed with the original task of picking up the can, please let me know how you would like to continue, or if you would like to attempt the detection again.'}]

The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6.

This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment.

Let's assume the can is located at [0.0, 0.8, 0.0] (x, y, z) for the purpose of this trajectory planning.\n\nNow, I will generate the code for the trajectory steps.\n\n### Step 1: Approach the can\n\nI will define a function to move the end-effector to a position directly above the can.\n\n```python\ndef approach_can(position, rotation):\n    trajectory = []\n    start_position = [0.0, 0.6, 0.55]  # Current position\n    target_position = [position[0], position[1], 0.1]  # Above the can\n    # Generate trajectory points\n    for i in range(100):\n        t = i / 99  # Normalized time\n        x = start_position[0] + t * (target_position[0] - start_position[0])\n        y = start_position[1] + t * (target_position[1] - start_position[1])\n        z = start_position[2] + t * (target_position[2] - start_position[2])\n        trajectory.append([x, y, z, rotation])\n    return trajectory\n\ntrajectory_1 = approach_can([0.0, 0.8, 0.0], 0)\n```\n\nNow, I will execute this trajectory.\n\n```python\nexecute_trajectory(trajectory_1)\n```"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ''}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'It seems that I need to continue with the next steps of the trajectory planning after executing the first trajectory. \n\n### Step 2: Lower the gripper\n\nNext, I will define a function to lower the end-effector down to the height of the can.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6.

This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6.

Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one. Name each trajectory variable with the trajectory number.\nStop generation after each code block to wait for it to finish executing before continuing with your plan.\n\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 4: \n\nThe user command is "pick up the can".\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'To begin the task of picking up the can, I will first detect the can in the environment to gather its position, orientation, and dimensions.

Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required.

If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name.

This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one. Name each trajectory variable with the trajectory number.\nStop generation after each code block to wait for it to finish executing before continuing with your plan.\n\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 4: \n\nThe user command is "pick up the can".\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'To begin the task of picking up the can, I will first need to detect the can in the environment.

This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop.

Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name.

The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop.

Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3.

Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps.

Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name.

The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop.

Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment.

I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one. Name each trajectory variable with the trajectory number.\nStop generation after each code block to wait for it to finish executing before continuing with your plan.\n\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 4: \n\nThe user command is "pick up the can".\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'To begin the task of picking up the can, I will first need to detect the can in the environment.

This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control.

This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6.

When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name.

If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories.

This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6.

This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one. Name each trajectory variable with the trajectory number.\nStop generation after each code block to wait for it to finish executing before continuing with your plan.\n\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 4: \n\nThe user command is "pick up the can".\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'To begin the task of picking up the can, I will first need to detect the can in the environment.

Given that the gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08 meters, I will need to ensure that I approach the can from a suitable angle. Typically, I would approach the midpoint of the can's narrow side to ensure a secure grip.\n\nNow, I will outline the step-by-step plan for the trajectory:\n\n1. **Rotate the End-Effector**: Rotate the end-effector to align with the narrow side of the can. This will likely involve a rotation of -π/2 radians (or -90 degrees) if the can is positioned upright.\n2. **Move to Above the Can**: Move the end-effector directly above the can at a height of 0.65 meters (0.1 meters above the can's top) to ensure clearance.\n3. **Lower the Gripper**: Lower the end-effector to the height of the can (assuming the can's height is less than 0.55 meters).\n4. **Close the Gripper**: Close the gripper to grasp the can.\n5. **Lift the Can**: Raise the end-effector to a height of 0.65 meters to clear the tabletop and any other objects.\n6. **Move to a Designated Location**: Move to a designated location to place the can down (this will be defined later).\n\nNow, I will generate the code for the first trajectory step, which is to rotate the end-effector.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_end_effector(rotation: float) -> list:\n    # Generate trajectory points for rotation\n    trajectory = []\n    for i in range(100):\n        angle = rotation * (i / 100)  # Interpolating the rotation\n        trajectory.append([0.0, 0.6, 0.55, angle])\n    return trajectory\n\ntrajectory_1 = rotate_end_effector(-1.5708)  # Rotate -90 degrees\nexecute_trajectory(trajectory_1)\n```"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ''}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Next, I will generate the code for the second trajectory step, which is to move the end-effector directly above the can.

The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one. Name each trajectory variable with the trajectory number.\nStop generation after each code block to wait for it to finish executing before continuing with your plan.\n\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 4: \n\nThe user command is "pick up the box".\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'To begin the task of picking up the box, I will first need to detect the box in the environment.

This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1.

Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps.

Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6.

This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding.

Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name.

The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.\n    2. The y-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name.

The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, 0.6, 0.55], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6.

Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the left.\n    2. The y-axis is getting far away from end-effector.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the left.\n    2. The y-axis is getting far away from end-effector.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0.

This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the left.\n    2. The y-axis is getting far away from end-effector.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the left.\n    2. The y-axis is getting far away from end-effector.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment.

If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories.

This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the left.\n    2. The y-axis is getting far away from end-effector.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment.

The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the left.\n    2. The y-axis is getting far away from end-effector.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code.

This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the left.\n    2. The y-axis is getting far away from end-effector.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one. Name each trajectory variable with the trajectory number.\nStop generation after each code block to wait for it to finish executing before continuing with your plan.\n\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 4: \n\nThe user command is "pick up the box and put down the box leftside of banana".\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'To complete the task of picking up the box and placing it to the left side of the banana, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Detect Objects**: First, we need to detect the positions, orientations, and dimensions of the box and the banana.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the left.\n    2. The y-axis is getting far away from end-effector.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one. Name each trajectory variable with the trajectory number.\nStop generation after each code block to wait for it to finish executing before continuing with your plan.\n\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 4: \n\nThe user command is "pick up the box and put down the box leftside of banana".\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'To complete the task of picking up the box and placing it to the left side of the banana, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Detect Objects**: First, we need to detect the positions, orientations, and dimensions of the box and the banana.

Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name.

The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the left.\n    2. The y-axis is getting far away from end-effector.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop.

The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1.

If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6.

Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a sentient AI that can control a robot arm by generating Python code which outputs a list of trajectory points for the robot arm end-effector to follow to complete a given user command.\nEach element in the trajectory list is an end-effector pose, and should be of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.\n\nAVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:\nYou must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.\nYou are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:\n0. The camera always starts in the stop state, so don\'t call anything other than the function you told me to do\n1. detect_object(object_or_object_part: str) -> None: This function will not return anything, but only print the position, orientation, and dimensions of any object or object part in the environment. This information will be printed for as many instances of the queried object or object part in the environment. If there are multiple objects or object parts to detect, call one function for each object or object part, all before executing any trajectories. The unit is in metres.\n2. execute_trajectory(trajectory: list) -> None: This function will execute the list of trajectory points on the robot arm end-effector, and will also not return anything.\n3. open_gripper() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n4. close_gripper() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.\n5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.\nWhen calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.\n\nENVIRONMENT SET-UP:\nThe 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:\n    1. The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the left.\n    2. The y-axis is getting far away from end-effector.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop. The end-effector is therefore able to rotate about the z-axis, from -pi to pi radians.\nThe end-effector gripper has two fingers, and they are currently parallel to the x-axis.\nThe gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08.\nNegative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. The rotation values should be in radians.\n\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE:\nIf the task requires interaction with multiple objects:\n1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.\n2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding. The height of an object is not the center of the object, but the length from highest to lowest in the object.\n\nVELOCITY CONTROL:\n1. The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one. Name each trajectory variable with the trajectory number.\nStop generation after each code block to wait for it to finish executing before continuing with your plan.\n\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 4: \n\nThe user command is "pick up the box and put down back side of banana".\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'To complete the task of picking up the box and placing it on the back side of the banana, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Detect Objects**: First, we need to detect the box and the banana to get their positions, orientations, and dimensions.

The x-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the left.\n    2. The y-axis is getting far away from end-effector.\n    3. The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop.

Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name.

The default speed of the robot arm end-effector is 20 points per trajectory.\n2. If you need to make the end-effector follow a particular trajectory more quickly, then generate fewer points for the trajectory, and vice versa.\n\nCODE GENERATION:\nWhen generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:\n1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 1: If there is a situation where you need to pick up an object, \nyou must first rotate the end effector so that it can grasp the narrow side of the object and then grasp the object.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 2:\nIf the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.\nThen, detect the necessary objects in the environment. Stop generation after this step to wait until you obtain the printed outputs from the detect_object function calls.\n\nINITIAL PLANNING 3:\nThen, output Python code to decide which object to interact with, if there are multiple instances of the same object.\nThen, describe how best to approach the object (for example, approaching the midpoint of the object, or one of its edges, etc.), depending on the nature of the task, or the object dimensions, etc.\nThen, output a detailed step-by-step plan for the trajectory, including when to lower the gripper to make contact with the object, if necessary.\nFinally, perform each of these steps one by one.

The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.\nThe robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [0.0, -0.59, 0.455], with the rotation value at 0, and the gripper open.\nThe robot arm is in a top-down set-up, with the end-effector facing down onto a tabletop.

It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given object information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.\n3. When moving an object, make the endpoint effector move after raising the height of the object being held and the height of the object on the path higher than the sum of the object on the path.\n4. When acting with interaction between objects, act with a margin of about 0.3 between objects.\n5. Always consider the height of an object to prevent it from colliding.

Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.\n2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 100 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.\n3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the execute_trajectory function after each trajectory step.\n4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.\n5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.\n6.
